This study aims to study and apply artificial Intelligence with reinforcement learning algorithm on certain game. The main purpose of this project contains two parts. 

Firstly, designing and making a video game with enough playabilities, which means it could give players enough operating space, and allow them to achieve higher scores on the premise of achieving game clearance. Before everything started, it is especially important to investigate and learn the corresponding game engine knowledge.

Secondly, learning and implementing the reinforcement learning algorithm and apply them to the game developed. Reinforcement learning is a branch of machine learning, and it contains several existing calculation theories. The main focus of algorithm research points to the Proximal Policy Optimization and Soft Actor-Critic algorithms. At the end of the project, their trained neural network model should be able to drive agents to play games independently according to the game rules, which means it could self-evolve and find a way to pass the game through constant experimentation, even try to find out more ways to achieve higher scores.

Furthermore, the development language mostly used by today’s famous game production engines, such as Unreal 4 and Unity is C# language. However, in terms of reinforcement learning algorithm, the existing mainstream algorithm framework uses python as its foundation. In other word, realizing the interaction between the algorithm and the game engine and improving its working efficiency are also the research goals of this project.

Through observing the prophase, metaphase, anaphase of agents’ training processes, the project could figure out whether artificial intelligence under a specific learning algorithm really has humanoid learning capabilities, and if there is a theoretical method to make it more efficient.

Points to Note
Click to Play

The project support multi-operating system on PC platform, such as Linux, mac and windows.
After the compressed package is decompressed, opening the folder directory, as shown in the following figure:
 
The ‘Click to play’ file contains Unity’s game export files, which allow players to play the game directly without Unity editor and any various extension packs. Open it, and you will see the following file directory. Then, you can click’gameEnv.exe’ file to play the game.

Download all the Compressed files, and unzip them to the same directory 

The testing version allows clients to run it directly without the demand on Unity or Tenserflow
